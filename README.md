# PDM_Project
Repository for the Planning and Decision Making Project Code

This README file will contain the links to the resources used in the project, references, links to tools used for developing the project or anything project-related in general that we want to gather in some place. Some general sections will be initially created, but more can be added, as well as subsections, when required.

## Project report

Go to Overleaf (I found no link for this one as I think it will depend on the person)
